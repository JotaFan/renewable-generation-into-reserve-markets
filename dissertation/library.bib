This framework was set out, however, when the vast majority of generation units were controllable and fuel-based. The increasing levels of renewable generation create unique challenges in the operation of EMs. In this context, flexibility markets are starting to be recognized as a promising and powerful tool to adequately valorize demand-side flexibility. This chapter describes the models underlying both centralized and bilateral markets, analyzes the operation of several European markets, introduces some energy management tools, analyzes the pressing issue of flexibility in system operation, and describes various pioneering flexibility platforms.},

   abstract = {There is a need for fundamental changes in the ways society views electric energy. Electric energy must be treated as a commodity which can be bought, sold, and traded, taking into account its time-and space-varying values and costs. This book presents a complete framework for the establishment of such an energy marketplace. The framework is based on the use of spot prices. In general terms: o An hourly spot price (in dollars per kilowatt hour) reflects the operating and capital costs of generating, transmitting and distributing electric energy. It varies each hour and from place to place. o The spot price based energy marketplace involves a variety of utility-customer transactions (ranging from hourly varying prices to long-term, multiple-year contracts), all of which are based in a consistent manner on hourly spot prices. These transactions may include customers selling to, as well as buying from, the utility. The basic theory and practical implementation issues associated with a spot price based energy marketplace have been developed and discussed through a number of different reports, theses, and papers. Each addresses only a part of the total picture, and often with a somewhat different notation and terminology (which has evolved in parallel with our growing experience).

   abstract = {Every day the Operator Transport Network (ORT) is facing new challenges that will have
to overcome in favor of providing users of the national electricity system with a service
quality, reliability and safety. At times, the electric sector was traditionally seen as a
natural monopoly, where a company, EDP, was responsible for all sector activities.
However, given the restructuring that took place throughout the sector, which led to the
introduction by weight of renewable energy sources and the liberalization of various
activities led to the value chain separation and accept the participation of various actors
in various activities, namely, the production and marketing, with the aim of creating a
more competitive and more advantageous environment for the consumer. This process
gave rise to challenges of greater complexity, among which there is the greatest volatility
in electricity production and a possibility of experiencing imbalances, for which system
services provision for the maintenance of the electrical system fullness is needed.
The continued development of the sector liberalization process culminated in the creation
of transnational electricity markets, grouping electricity markets in different countries in
a single market. The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), is an example of an
international market which incorporates in itself the electricity markets in Portugal and
Spain. The MIBEL in addition to other responsibilities coordinates the management of
the Daily Market and Intraday Market, where you set the electricity price and the price
thereof to be traded the next day and every hour of the day.
With regard to the System Services Market, whose responsibility is the system manager,
and are characterized by estimating the differences that may occur in an electrical system,
develop resolution plans for them and finally arrange and implement the solution. The
resolution involves the procurement of supplies in quantities able to cope with anomalies
recorded in the system services market.
This research focuses on the System Services, in particular on frequency regulation,
including secondary and tertiary regulation reserve for the electrical systems of Portugal
and Spain for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Under the regulation reserve, an analysis of the creation of an internal market concerning
the commercialization of regulation reserve was carried out in parallel, was conceived to
viione analysis support tool in Microsoft Office Excel that allows you to view as graphics
stored data relating to offers of market agents, contracted reserve, the marginal cost of
these offers and finally, the cost of closing the market. The same tool also enables the
user to make a simulation to the desired day of what may occur in regulatory reserve
market in accordance with the provisions ERSE.
With respect to the reserve secondary regulation, we carried out a study of the possible
optimization of the values of the supply requirements of such reserves, with the intention
to decrease the closing market price at each time.
The results showed that there is still great potential for development of system services,
more specifically in the management of the secondary reserve and regulating the market,
which will culminate in the creation of a single market at European level, the benefit of
which will be based on reduced costs for the system and therefore to the final consumers.
The creation of a single regulatory reserve market is one of the proposals, and the positive
values achieved enable its creation, however, due to the complexity of the secondary
reserve market presents the creation of a single market is still a process which will have
difficulties to be implemented. However, the proposal for obtaining the value of
secondary reserve enables the GGS needs an optimization of the costs associated with the
system.},

   abstract = {In order to increase the amount of renewable energy generation in the electrical grids and
at the same time keep the existing power quality and safety of supply, it is mandatory that
these energy sources not only deliver energy, but also perform ancillary services. Consequently
the wind, solar, water and biomass units should be able to supply frequency containment,
restoration and replacement reserve services.
The installed capacity of wind generators has risen in recent years, which means that
increasingly larger shares of electricity will be supplied by these sources. During off-peak hours
this will lead to situations where wind generators become the main electricity supplier.
Therefore, wind farms should be encouraged to participate in balance markets so that the
system’s stability does not become threatened.
In this dissertation, it is analysed the possibility and the impact of Wind Farms in
participating in the electrical energy market and in the replacement reserve market.
This work starts with an investigation, on the existing literature, with regard to the physical
feasibility of wind farms to provide active power control. Afterwards it is delineated different
forecasting tools: of wind power production, of regulation’s direction and needed power and
of balance market prices. This literature review is compulsory for a better understanding of the
problem of bidding in balance markets.
Subsequently it is formulated the decision problem to define the offers of a wind farm.
Then a decision support model, based on probabilistic forecasts of: wind generation, balance
market prices and regulation’s direction, for the offering of control reserve provision is
presented. Different decision strategies were implemented, and from the comparison of them
conclusions were made.},

   abstract = {The paper considers different market settings for the participation to the balancing services market of small scale variable renewable energy sources connected to the distribution grid. By mixing an economical and a technical approach, it evaluates the efficiency of participation to the market under two distinct approaches to resources' aggregation: a commercial scheme and a technical one. In the former, the supply of the small scale variable distributed renewable energy sources is grouped on a purely commercial basis; in the latter, the distribution system operator is responsible of the imbalances that may possibly arise in the distribution grid and aggregates the sources from a technical perspective. By considering a reference distribution network and designing scenarios for the forecast uncertainty about supply and demand of power profiles, the impact of different market frameworks is assessed. The upward and downward balancing services provided by variable distributed energy resources and controllable units connected to the high voltage grid are both considered. Moreover, the power supply curtailments, that endogenously arise due to the violation of technical constraints of the distribution grid and the random nature of energy supply by renewables, are addressed, for each specific market model. As a general outcome of this research, it is shown that providing balancing energy based on a commercial approach is preferable as long as renewables' curtailment penalty is low and local generators have correlated forecast errors (as in the case of photovoltaic units) with a large reserve capacity. High penalties for curtailment and lower correlation among generation schedule deviations, along with a lower reserve by distributed units, make the technical approach more convenient.},

Also, it may be possible to sell extra electricity back to distribution companies. However, the efficiency of photovoltaic systems varies according to several factors, such as the solar exposition at ground levels, atmospheric temperature, and relative humidity, and predicting the energy generated by such a system is not easy. This work is on the use of deep learning to predict the generation of photovoltaic energy by residential systems. We use real-world data to evaluate the performance of LSTM, Convolutional, and hybrid Convolutional-LSTM networks in predicting photovoltaic power generation at different forecasting horizons. We also assess the generalizability of the solutions, evaluating the use of models trained with data aggregated by geographic areas to predict the energy generation by individual systems. We compare the performance of deep networks with Prophet in terms of MAE, RMSE, and NRMSE, and in most cases, Convolutional and Convolutional-LSTM networks achieve the best results. Using models trained with region-based data to predict the power generation of individual systems is confirmed to be a promising approach.},

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

   abstract = {Time series forecasting is a crucial task in machine learning , as it has a wide range of applications including but not limited to forecasting electricity consumption, traffic, and air quality. Traditional forecasting models rely on rolling averages, vector auto-regression and auto-regressive integrated moving averages. On the other hand, deep learning and matrix factorization models have been recently proposed to tackle the same problem with more competitive performance. However, one major drawback of such models is that they tend to be overly complex in comparison to traditional techniques. In this paper, we report the results of prominent deep learning models with respect to a well-known machine learning baseline, a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model. Similar to the deep neural network (DNN) models, we transform the time series forecasting task into a window-based regression problem. Furthermore, we feature-engineered the input and output structure of the GBRT model, such that, for each training window, the target values are concatenated with external features, and then flattened to form one input instance for a multi-output GBRT model. We conducted a comparative study on nine datasets for eight state-of-the-art deep-learning models that were presented at top-level conferences in the last years. The results demonstrate that the window-based input transformation boosts the performance of a simple GBRT model to levels that outperform all state-of-the-art DNN models evaluated in this paper.},

In order to mobile cloud service composition as an NP-Hard problem, an efficient selection method should be taken by problem using optimal energy-aware methods that can extend the deployment and interoperability of mobile cloud components. Also, an energy-aware service composition mechanism is required to preserve high energy saving scenarios for mobile cloud components. In this paper, an energy-aware mechanism is applied to optimize mobile cloud service composition using a hybrid Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (SFGA). Experimental results capture that the proposed mechanism improves the feasibility of the service composition with minimum energy consumption, response time, and cost for mobile cloud components against some current algorithms.},

   abstract = {With increasing penetration of solar and wind energy to the total energy supply mix, the pressing need for accurate energy forecasting has become well-recognized. Here we report the development of a machine-learning based model blending approach for statistically combining multiple meteorological models for improving the accuracy of solar/wind power forecast. Importantly, we demonstrate that in addition to parameters to be predicted (such as solar irradiance and power), including additional atmospheric state parameters which collectively define weather situations as machine learning input provides further enhanced accuracy for the blended result. Functional analysis of variance shows that the error of individual model has substantial dependence on the weather situation. The machine-learning approach effectively reduces such situation dependent error thus produces more accurate results compared to conventional multi-model ensemble approaches based on simplistic equally or unequally weighted model averaging. Validation over an extended period of time results show over 30\% improvement in solar irradiance/power forecast accuracy compared to forecasts based on the best individual model.},

Existing literature explicate that the supervised based machine learning algorithms are intelligent for predictions such as future load demand, wind, solar and geothermal energy forecasting, etc., across the wide range of applications. In this study, a comprehensive review is conducted on supervised based machine learning algorithms by using three well-known forecasting engines. This review aims to suggest suitable methods for forecasting analysis and several other prediciton tasks. A particular objective is to investigate and analyzed the methods used to forecast energy, real time use in multiple applications and to identify the research review with useful techniques that are approachable in the current literature. This review contains a critical comparison and study among various modeling techniques to choose a better forecasting model for performing the desired task in multiple applications. The forecasting accuracy is compared and analyzed through comprehensive literature review and with the real-time energy consumption and climate data used for modeling analysis. The Bayesian regularization backpropagation neural networks (BRBNNs) and the Levenberg Marquardt backpropagation neural networks (LMBNNs) render higher forecasting accuracy and performance with the coefficient of correlation 0.972 and 0.971 respectively. The supervised learning is useful for real-time applications because of optimal scenario of a specific model will allow for the model to precisely predict the label's class for unseen data instances. Additionally, the supervised learning can reduce the noise and control imbalanced data in the network formulation.},

Yet, the high complexity of the tasks associated with DR, combined with their use of large-scale data and the frequent need for near real-time decisions, means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — a branch of AI — have recently emerged as key technologies for enabling demand-side response. AI methods can be used to tackle various challenges, ranging from selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, scheduling and control of devices, learning how to incentivise participants in the DR schemes and how to reward them in a fair and economically efficient way. This work provides an overview of AI methods utilised for DR applications, based on a systematic review of over 160 papers, 40 companies and commercial initiatives, and 21 large-scale projects. The papers are classified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy DR. Next, commercial initiatives are presented (including both start-ups and established companies) and large-scale innovation projects, where AI methods have been used for energy DR. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different DR tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.},

   abstract = {Markets for electric energy and reserves are linked as the same physical assets operate in both markets. Two different designs are commonly used for clearing energy and reserve markets; joint clearing or sequential clearing. It's generally accepted that joint clearing results in higher (or at least the same) social welfare than a pure sequential clearing. However, the impact of an increasing share of intermittent renewables on the interdependency between energy and reserves has been underexposed in literature. This paper studies the coupling between day-ahead energy markets and reserve markets for allocation and activation, and this for different shares of intermittent renewables (i.e. wind and solar PV). Towards this end, a large scale unit commitment model is deployed to a case study inspired by the Central Western European system. Different scenarios, developed within the EU-SysFlex project, are considered. The study indicates that the interdependency between energy and reserve markets increases with increasing share of intermittent renewables. As such, the cost difference, evaluated in real-time, between joint and sequential clearing increase as well with increasing share of intermittent renewables. The analysis shows that this impact can be partially compensated by an increasing role of renewables and flexible load in reserve provision.},

There are many approaches that could be applied for the prediction of global solar radiation (GSR).

The extent to which data based decisions are made for planning such as judicious and functional for the solar energy sector has been increased to a large extent by this giant step. In modelling challenging and unpredictable connections in between a set of input data and output data along with specific patterns that occur between datasets, AI techniques have demonstrated increasing reliability.

In this paper, we design a data-driven method augmented by an effective information fusion mechanism to learn from historical data that incorporates prior knowledge from NWP. We cast the weather forecasting problem as an end-to-end deep learning problem and solve it by proposing a novel negative log-likelihood error (NLE) loss function. A notable advantage of our proposed method is that it simultaneously implements single-value forecasting and uncertainty quantification, which we refer to as deep uncertainty quantification (DUQ). Efficient deep ensemble strategies are also explored to further improve performance. This new approach was evaluated on a public dataset collected from weather stations in Beijing, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NLE loss significantly improves generalization compared to mean squared error (MSE) loss and mean absolute error (MAE) loss. Compared with NWP, this approach significantly improves accuracy by 47.76\%, which is a state-of-the-art result on this benchmark dataset. The preliminary version of the proposed method won 2nd place in an online competition for daily weather forecasting1},

Four new empirical models are introduced and validated with experimental data. This work is focused on the prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation (GSR) for different cities in India with most influencing input parameters identified using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. WEKA identifies month, latitude, maximum temperature and bright sunshine hours as the most influencing and relative humidity as the least influencing input parameter. SVM model with most influencing input parameter performs better than ANN and Empirical models. Exclusion of relative humidity does not affect the prediction accuracy. Therefore this work reduces the dimensionality of the data and improves the prediction accuracy.

Since max pooling featured prominently in earlier generations of image classifiers, we wish to understand this trend, and whether it is justified. We develop a theoretical framework analyzing ReLU based approximations to max pooling, and prove a sense in which max pooling cannot be efficiently replicated using ReLU activations. We analyze the error of a class of optimal approximations, and find that whilst the error can be made exponentially small in the kernel size, doing so requires an exponentially complex approximation. Our work gives a theoretical basis for understanding the trend away from max pooling in newer architectures. We conclude that the main cause of a difference between max pooling and an optimal approximation, a prevalent large difference between the max and other values within pools, can be overcome with other architectural decisions, or is not prevalent in natural images.},

A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually "modernize" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.},

   abstract = {At present, a harmonized pan-European electricity market (EM) is a close reality. While in day-ahead markets (DAMs) the harmonization is at an advanced stage, in balancing markets (BMs) still exist some challenging issues, notably the remuneration of imbalances: some countries have simple and clear methods, but others consider complex methods that are not appealing to the participation of variable renewable energy (VRE). The participation of VRE in BMs is technically feasible, although with some restrictions to guarantee security and stability. Thus the economic attractiveness of these markets should be increased in order to enable full integration of VRE without feed-in-tariffs or other incentives. This article presents an overview of EMs, focusing on European BMs, and also investigates the benefits of the participation of wind power producers (WPPs) in BMs at both economic and technical levels. In particular, the article presents a new strategy allowing WPPs to bid in BMs. It also presents a study involving four scenarios, where WPPs participate in: (a) the DAM (baseline scenario), (b) the DAM and the automatic-activated frequency restoration reserve market, (c) the DAM and the manually activated FRR (mFRR) market, and (d) the DAM and a 15-min mFRR market. The simulations are performed with the agent-based system MATREM (for Multi-Agent TRading in EMs). For the last scenario, the results indicate an increase around 6\% in the wind energy value to the market, a decrease of 12\% in the total reserve used, and a decrease around 16\% in the costs from the BM. agent-based system, balancing markets, simulation-based study, strategic bidding, wind power producers 1 | INTRODUCTION The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) in power supply systems is progressively increasing, while the share of conventional generation is decreasing. To ensure that the power supply continue functioning reliably and in a cost-effective way, electricity markets (EMs) should be adapted to this new paradigm (e.g., Lopes & Coelho, 2018a). Contrary to conventional generation, appropriately designed to control the power output, VRE units are nondispatchable and dependent of stochastic weather conditions. Since these conditions can be forecasted, the possible contributions from VRE can be considered schedul-able, although with uncertainties associated with forecast errors. In order to minimize such uncertainties, the input of VRE should be scheduled as close as possible to real-time operation.},
