   abstract = {The European pathway to carbon neutrality indicates strong investments in variable renewable energy sources. Demand-side and variable renewable players rely on forecasts to participate in day-ahead markets closing between 12 and 37 hours ahead of real-time operation. As such, the further from the real-time operation those forecasts are provided, the higher their errors and the uncertainty. Deviations from the market schedules are balanced using real-time reserves. Traditionally, transmission system operators (TSOs) use a symmetrical procurement of up and down reserves based on the expected demand. This work considers the computation of a dynamic up and down procurement of secondary capacities by considering the expected deviations, using the day-ahead programmed and expected dispatches of variable renewables, demand, other technologies, and the cross-border capacities. The study uses operational open data from the Spanish TSO from 2019 to 2022. The proposed methodology allows increasing the usage of the up and down secondary capacities by almost 13\% and 8\%, respectively, freeing up 11\% of the allocated resources, on average.},

   abstract = {At present, a harmonized pan-European electricity market (EM) is a close reality. While in day-ahead markets (DAMs) the harmonization is at an advanced stage, in balancing markets (BMs) still exist some challenging issues, notably the remuneration of imbalances: some countries have simple and clear methods, but others consider complex methods that are not appealing to the participation of variable renewable energy (VRE). The participation of VRE in BMs is technically feasible, although with some restrictions to guarantee security and stability. Thus the economic attractiveness of these markets should be increased in order to enable full integration of VRE without feed-in-tariffs or other incentives. This article presents an overview of EMs, focusing on European BMs, and also investigates the benefits of the participation of wind power producers (WPPs) in BMs at both economic and technical levels. In particular, the article presents a new strategy allowing WPPs to bid in BMs. It also presents a study involving four scenarios, where WPPs participate in: (a) the DAM (baseline scenario), (b) the DAM and the automatic-activated frequency restoration reserve market, (c) the DAM and the manually activated FRR (mFRR) market, and (d) the DAM and a 15-min mFRR market. The simulations are performed with the agent-based system MATREM (for Multi-Agent TRading in EMs). For the last scenario, the results indicate an increase around 6\% in the wind energy value to the market, a decrease of 12\% in the total reserve used, and a decrease around 16\% in the costs from the BM.

This causes a “cannibalization effect” through which increasing renewable technologies’ penetration undermines their own value. We calculate solar and wind daily unit revenues (generation weighted electricity prices) and value factors (unit revenues divided by average electricity prices) from hourly data of the day-ahead California wholesale electricity market (CAISO) for the period January 2013 to June 2017. We then perform a time series econometric analysis to test the absolute (unit revenues) and relative (value factors) cannibalization effect of solar and wind technologies, as well as the cross-cannibalization effects between technologies. We find both absolute and relative cannibalization effect for both solar and wind, but while wind penetration reduces the value factor of solar, solar penetration increases wind value factor, at least at high penetration and low consumption levels. We explore non-linearities and also find that the cannibalization effect is stronger at low consumption and high wind/solar penetration levels. This entails that wind and (mainly) solar competitiveness could be jeopardized unless additional mitigation measures such as storage, demand management or intercontinental interconnections are taken.},

Portugal is an interesting case study because wind generation already accounts for a high fraction of demand (23\% in 2012-2016), but still there are no economic incentives for efficient wind forecasting (wind balancing costs are passed to end consumers). We analyze the evolution of the balancing market from 2012 to 2016. Using actual market data, we find wind balancing costs around 2 euros per MWh of generated energy. One main reason for these low costs is the existence of a robust transmission grid, which allows for the compensation of positive with negative wind imbalances across the system. Nevertheless, the results suggest that final consumers could save several million euros per year if wind generators were made responsible for the economic cost of their imbalances, in line with other European markets.},

   abstract = {When the share of variable renewable energy, such as wind energy, in the energy system becomes large, the integration cost increases in accordance with the depletion of flexible ramping capabilities of the system. Therefore, integration of large shares of wind power into power system operations calls for market integration as well as for additional flexibility. Among the various available options, wind power plants themselves have the technical potential of offering flexibility. Using the Danish market conditions as a case study, we model and analyze four strategies for the participation of a wind power producer in day-ahead and real-time electricity markets, and compare how they affect the value of wind power production. Our findings suggest that wind power plants can have a more solid business case if they are active on both day-ahead and real-time power markets, which increases the economic value of wind energy as well as reduces the system integration costs. We also highlight that support schemes can affect the incentives for active participation on real-time power markets. This type of insight is valuable for wind power's potential to expand its market share while keeping a high economic value in power markets, where the political trend is towards market based deployment of renewables and focus on low system integration costs.

   abstract = {Power grids are undergoing deregulation, privatization, and decentralization worldwide. The smart grid allows the integration of clean power renewable energy technologies to the utility grid through mini, micro, and nano grids. Conventional centralized power grids used to rely on fossil fuel-fired power plants which are being replaced worldwide with solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, biomass, wave, and alternative energy technologies. Installed solar and wind power generation capacity has surpassed 1300 GW in 2020. Solar and wind powers rise during the day and fall during the evening. Consumer demand increases steadily during the evening and peaks after sunset when solar generation becomes zero and wind power falls substantially. Decentralized smart grid faces duck curve limitation on the integration of renewable energy technologies as centralized utilities used to face the peak-hours issue. Smart grid operators have no effective solution of load peaking after sundown except keeping fossil fuel-fired plants on standby to ride through the duck curve. We present a solution to the duck curve problem by integrating smart load shedding devices in micro and nano grids to adjust their demand frugally during peak hours to support the national grid. Information and communication (ICT) technologies that enabled the internet of things (IoT) have been attempted to facilitate smart load shedding in nano grids. ICT enabled voltage transformers (VT) and current transformers (CT) supply signals to heuristic rules based multifunction smart relaying system. Smart meters, instrument transformers, and status monitoring field devices generate a massive amount of data. The research designed an IoT and LabVIEW based software platform to carry out demand-side management. Under frequency (UF) and under-voltage (UV) relaying functions were used to conduct load shedding in nano grids. This nanoscale demand-side management experiment paves the way to ride through utility-scale duck curve setback. This PT/CT data based economic solution performs at nanoscale same as ABB PML 630 load shedding controller. This UF and UV relaying based multifunction relay starts shedding loads when frequency falls below <1\% and voltage below 10\% of rated values. Our load shedding scheme has successfully functioned on nanoscale 5 kW system. The future study section proposes to integrate big data technologies in-home energy management system (HEMS) through extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline to import data from PT/CT and circuit breakers (CB) integrated smart meter to transform it according to requirement by loading data into Hadoop “big data” processing platforms for utility-scale load management with help of day-ahead load and weather-dependent renewable power generation forecasting techniques.},

This mechanism generates gains for the Portuguese electrical system. However, with a high level of cooperation, these gains could be improved. The Portuguese TSO is one of the most peripheral TSOs in Europe and, as such, it considerably benefits from market integration, in the various dimensions of the electrical sector. Hence, as a new contribution to earlier studies, this paper evaluates, from the Portuguese strategic perspective, what would happen to revenues when sharing replacement reserves without any restriction, considering a full integration of Europe's southwest countries in contrast to the traditional bilateral solution that is currently in place.

Spot markets are composed of day-ahead, intraday and real-time markets, and their prices are highly volatile. Derivative markets are composed of physical and financial products to hedge against spot price volatility. Players can set the terms and conditions of private bilateral contracts but these have several risks that can be mitigated using a risk management process composed of three phases: risk assessment, characterization and hedging. This paper focuses on both risk attitude and risk-sharing, and how they can influence the negotiation of the price. It presents the standard and non-standard designs of a new type of contract, the Risk-Sharing Contract (RSC). Furthermore, it describes the trading process of these contracts and introduces a negotiation strategy for dealing with risk. It also presents case studies on bilateral contracting involving the negotiation of RSCs, where different demand and supply agents interact and trade according to the rules of an alternating offers protocol. Results from the case studies prove the benefit of RSCs to hedging against spot price volatility, benefiting risk-averse players by reducing the price risk and conducting mutually beneficial agreements. While the use of derivatives products can conduct losses/revenues between -15\% and 3\% concerning the spot market, by using non-standard RSCs those outputs vary between -1\% and 3\% with substantially less risk.},

This paper revisits the current sizing method applied in Belgium, which is based on a static approach that determines the required capacity once a year. The presented dynamic sizing method determines the required capacity on a daily basis, using the estimated probability of facing a system imbalance during the next day. This risk is estimated based on historical observations of system conditions by means of machine learning algorithms. A proof of concept is presented for the Belgian system, and demonstrates that the proposed methodology improves reliability management while decreasing the average capacity to be contracted. The method is compliant with European market design, and the corresponding regulatory framework, and is of particular interest for systems with a high share of renewable generation. For these reasons a gradual implementation in Belgium towards 2020 has been decided based on the results of this study.},

Thus, many economies that share concerns about climate change, invest in renewable sources to help contain the global warming. However, the massive integration of these renewable sources, which brings more intermittency and volatility, together with the natural variation of consumption, pose greater challenges that should be mitigated with adequate tools, as offered by a liberalized and organized electrical market. To help cost reduction in a market environment, the coordination between different Transmission System Operators (TSOs) is of utmost importance. The objective of this work is to provide a framework analysis for the sharing of ancillary services (AS) in the context of the Iberian ES, in particular a techno-economic analysis for the secondary reserve (SR) control. The SR control is fundamental to correct load variations and help stabilize the ES where the TSOs are inserted.

Secondary control is key in restoring the power system to its reference following a disturbance. Underestimating the necessary control capacity may require emergency measures, such that a solid understanding of its predictability and driving factors is needed. Here, we establish an explainable machine learning model for the analysis of secondary control power in Germany. Training gradient boosted trees, we obtain an accurate ex-post description of control activation. Our explainable model demonstrates the strong impact of external drivers such as forecasting errors and the generation mix, while daily patterns in the reserve activation play a minor role. Training a prototypical forecasting model, we identify forecast error estimates as crucial to improve predictability. Generally, input data and model training have to be carefully adapted to serve the different purposes of either ex-post analysis or forecasting and reserve sizing.},

   abstract = {The liberalization of the retail market of electricity increased the tariff choice of end-use consumers. Retailers compete in the retail market for customers, obtaining private portfolios of end-use consumers to manage. Retailers buy electricity at wholesale markets to feed their customers’ demands. They can use spot, derivatives, and bilateral markets to acquire the energy they need. The increasing levels of variable renewable energy sources trading at spot markets, increase the price volatility of these markets. To hedge against the volatility of spot prices, retailers may negotiate standard physical or financial bilateral contracts at derivatives markets. Alternatively, they can also negotiate private bilateral contracts. This article addresses the optimization of the retailers purchasing options, to increase their risk-return ratio from electricity markets, and offer more competitive tariffs to consumers. Considering the risk attitude of retailers, they use a multi-step purchasing model composed of a multi-level risk-return optimization and a decision support system. The article presents an agent-based study considering a retailer with a portfolio of 312 real-world consumers. Risk-seeking and risk-neutral retailers obtained a return up to 38\%, less than 7\% of the optimal return. However, risk-neutral retailers are subject to four times higher risk in their returns than risk-seeking retailers. The results support the conclusion that wholesale markets of electricity are more favourable to risk-seeking retailers, considering their real returns.},

Multiple actors with divergent or competing interests must interact to deliver electrical energy and keep the lights on. Conventional optimization problems are often no longer relevant. Instead, dozens of new questions are being asked about a physical system that has not changed. To deliver the promised benefits of competition, old issues must be addressed in radically new ways.

   abstract = {The "Roaring 20s" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually "modernize" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.},

The study also concerns the company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) cost intra-industry analysis related to sector characteristics such as total assets, revenues, market capitalization, and companies’ age. In order to assess the intergroup relationships, basic correlation relationships were compared and a nonparametric test of variance was performed. The period under study covered the years 2015–2019. The conducted research evaluates groups of companies that dedicated their activity to a particular energy intra-industry division under numerous regulations in Europe. The study contributes to assessing the level of risk among energy listed companies in European capital markets based on capital structure valuation. The study results underline the role of the cost of equity financing, which was twice as high as the cost of debt. The highest WACC was related to the Beta indicator that also expressed the political and regulatory risk over the investigated period. Across debt cost analysis, the role of effective tax rate decreased the level of WACC. The highest level of WACC was noticed among uranium and integrated oil and gas companies. The study contributes to information asymmetry theory related to the cost of capital assumptions.},

Companies operate in an increasingly volatile environment, due to twin transitions and interlinked crises, and so they must have specific tools for measuring risk and profitability, in order to enable them to have a sound financial policy. Based on the earlier results obtained by Modigliani and Miller (1963), Harris and Pringle (1985), and Farber, Gillet, and Szafarz (2006), this study shows the relationship between WACC and interest rate. It offers a modified WACC formula that considers unstable market circumstances. The new redefined WACC can be a valuable tool in business planning for companies from different fields. The companies in the energy sector are very interested in the topic of WACC, considering not only the complex nature of the investments made and the long-term nature of investment recovery but also the multiple risks that have an impact on their activity and that can be found in different economic, social, and geopolitical spheres.},

We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step.

We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

   abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

An alternative is to estimate the missing values by regression techniques and to calculate a revised variance-covariance matrix. This method is suitable for use with an electronic computer.

New agents, such as batteries, may join frequency regulation markets but they require accurate information about future market prices and service demand trends in order to make their participation profitable. This paper proposes and analyzes the accuracy of various deep learning-based models to estimate the secondary reserve marginal band price in the automatic frequency restoration reserves service of the Iberian electricity market. First, a correlation analysis allows determining various subsets of market variables used as model inputs. These subsets include some highly correlated variables together with different combinations of others whose influenced is analyzed. Next, three different neural network techniques are considered: feedforward, convolutional and recurrent networks. For each of them, a random search is performed to obtain the best set of hyperparameters. The analysis of the results shows how the LSTM model returns the best performance metrics (63.22 % of mean absolute scaled error), clearly improving the state-of-the-art in the domain.},

   abstract = {To decarbonize electrical power systems, it is essential to incorporate a high share of variable renewable energy sources while minimizing their costs. An important step towards this goal includes exploring the potential for the so-called hybrid renewable power plants through the combination of (existing) wind and solar power parks. Although that is not the usual approach in their design, hybrid power plants should take advantage of existing synergies, as generation complementarity among the renewable generation technologies, and benefit from using existing infrastructures and the same grid connection point. This investigation assesses the potential of existing Portuguese wind parks for hybridization with solar power photovoltaic generation. Correlation and energy metrics for assessing the complementarity at hourly and daily periods are applied to quantify existing synergies. Results show a high potential for hybrid power plants: levels of complementarity between wind and solar resources are globally high thus allowing to increase the share of variable renewable energy sources with minimal energy curtailment, when compared with scenarios of overplanting additional wind power capacity. The highest and most consistent levels of complementarity are found in the interior regions of central and northern Portugal. The research shows that Portugal has privileged weather conditions that allow the concept of hybrid power plants to be largely explored and extended on a large and efficient scale. This outcome, which may be replicated for other countries, is an important contribution to increasing the penetration of renewable energy in electrical power systems while minimizing the overall costs of renewable energy.},

@article{Algarvio:20,
   abstract = {The European Union defined ambitious targets for the production of energy from renewable energy sources. Most European markets trade now high levels of variable renewable energy (VRE). Renewable generation increases the variability and uncertainty of the net-load (i.e., demand minus VRE). To a large extent, this variability and uncertainty can be compensated by hydroelectric power plants. Typically, hydro power producers (HPPs) consider the periods of time with low market prices (and normally low demand and/or high VRE production) to pump, and the periods with high market prices (and normally high demand and/or low VRE production) to produce energy. This article presents a model for hydro power plants and a study to analyse the hydro-wind balance in a real-world setting, namely a simplified version of the Portuguese power system, involving a significant penetration of hydro and wind power (more than 50%). The study is conducted with the help of the multi-agent system MATREM. The results confirm (and rebut) the typical behavior of hydroelectric power plants (to produce energy, to pump water or to stay idle).},

As expressed in their final NECPs, although Member States’ responses vary, most of the critical components were partially addressed, while the others were largely addressed. We observe a considerable variation in Member States’ strategies. Member States classified as foot-dragging beforehand are fence-sitting now, while those previously categorised as fence-sitting are now either foot-dragging or pace-setting. The root cause of these classification changes for the Member States within the EU can be traced back to their internal environments in which the involved stakeholders each have a different response pace regarding environment, climate, and energy. We present and analyse our theoretical context, discuss the EU’s energy policies and the NECPs, examine Member States’ responses and compliance with this new framework, and propose several challenges.},

   abstract = {Global climatic changes and increased carbon footprints provided the main impetus for the decrease in the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation. Matured manufacturing technologies of solar PV panels and on-shore and off-shore windmills have brought down the cost of generation of electricity using solar energy on par with conventional fossil fuel. Initially, solar and wind power generation was envisioned for microgrids, serving small local communities. However, advancements in power electronics have now facilitated large solar and wind farms to be integrated with main power grids. In this context, hosting capacity, which is the amount of distributed energy resources a grid can accommodate, without significant infrastructure up-gradation, has gained importance. In determining the hosting capacity at a particular location, the uncertainties of wind and solar power generation play a role. Effective forecasting models using time-series weather data can be built to predict wind and solar power generation. This forecast is essential to ensure proper grid operation and control when renewable energy sources are already installed. The forecast is also useful in the planning stages for investment decisions and distribution system planning. While long-term forecasts are rarely needed for the operation of integrated grids, accurate short-term predictive models are necessary for scheduling. This paper presents an extensive review of various forecast models available in the literature. The study mainly focuses on the short-term forecast, providing a critical review of the duration of data used in each model and a synoptic comparison of their performance indices.},

   abstract = {As the share of wind power increases in the power system, also the share of uncertain generation increases. This, in turn, increases the total balancing energy, real-time balancing power requirements and ramping of the balancing generation. In this study, the impact of wind power forecast errors on the real-time balancing need was investigated for different shares of wind energy (4–30%) in Finland and the Nordic region (comprising Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden). The size of the aggregation area of the net imbalances has an impact on the net imbalance volumes. The larger the size of the area is, the smaller the normalised net imbalance volumes are. In Finland, the impact of wind forecast errors on the net imbalance volumes and the largest net imbalances is almost two times as large as the impact of wind power forecast errors in the Nordic region. A shorter forecast horizon has an impact of similar magnitude both on reducing the net imbalance volumes and the largest net imbalances and on aggregating imbalances from large spatial areas. When day-ahead forecasts are not corrected intraday (ID) the impact on the net imbalance volumes and the largest net imbalances is twice as large as when ID forecasts are used.},
