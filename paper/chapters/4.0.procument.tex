This study proposes a dynamic procurement based on machine learning techniques trained with historical hourly data. With custom made model architectures



\subsection{Methodology Implementation}

The methodology aplied was a "brute force" choosing of better model, which can lead to better fine tuning results than a more complex architecture as shown in \cite{Liu2022}. With multiple model related variables in study:\par

\input{tables/muaddib_variables.tex}

Where each of the model variables in study where a layer of training, giving the best model within that scope we would go to the next variable with the given best option so far. Going back and forward as to not loose best possible choices.\par

For the porpuse of controling and processing this experiment three python packages were created.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/alquimodelia/alquimodelia}{Alquimodelia}}: A keras based model builder package, to create the necessary models with each different arch and variable.
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/alquimodelia/alquitable}{Alquitable}}: A keras based workshop package, to create custom callbacks, loss functions, data generators.
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/alquimodelia/MuadDib}{MuadDib}}: A machine learning framework that uses alquimodelia to test and choose best models on given conditions automatically.
\end{itemize}

The experiments were done using \href{https://keras.io/}{keras}>=3 with a torch backend on a CPU laptop.

% \subsubsection{Advance Loss Function}


% Para escolher a melhor maneira de distribuir pesos foi criada uma função de perda com diferentes regras, que distribuem o peso da amostra:
% \href{https://github.com/alquimodelia/alquitable/blob/main/alquitable/advanced_losses.py#L33}{Mirror Weights (Pesos Espelhados)},
% que vai distribuir os pesos da amostra consoante um rácio predefinido e o próprio erro da amostra.\par
% Os pesos nas amostras vão ser divididos entre os erros negativos (alocação em demasia) e os positivos (alocação em falta). Consoante uma variável lógica,  uns terão peso 1 e os outros serão o próprio erro em absoluto. Dando assim um peso equivalente ao erro, quanto maior o erro maior o peso da amostra na função de perda, do lado da amostra escolhido (em demasia ou em falta).\par
% O rácio pode ser multiplicado um rácio tanto a um dos pesos como a outro, sendo estes rácios que irão equilibrar as diferenças entre a alocação em falta e a em demasia. Refira-se que o sinal do rácio influencia qual o lado a ser multiplicado.\par
% Este pesos são passados directamente à função de perda em uso.\par

% Estas variações no rácio produzem diferentes dimensões nas alocações, modificando assim a sua posição em relação ao \textit{benchmark}. Aqui para cada arquitetura o rácio ideal para o melhor GPD Positivo diferencia ligeiramente, tendo sido procurado com tentativa/erro baseado em assunções perante a aparente distribuição rácio/alocações.\par


\subsection{Metrics}

% To address the challenges introduced by \gls{vRES}, dynamic reserve procurement methods have been proposed. Unlike static methods, dynamic approaches consider real-time or near real-time forecasts of energy demand and renewable generation, allowing \gls{TSO}s to adjust reserve allocations accordingly. This adaptability reduces over-procurement and minimizes costs, improving the efficiency of reserve markets.

% The adoption of advanced forecasting tools, particularly machine learning techniques, is central to enabling dynamic reserve procurement. By leveraging historical and operational data, machine learning models can predict reserve needs with greater accuracy, addressing the uncertainties associated with \gls{vRES} generation. Studies have shown that these models outperform traditional statistical methods, offering significant improvements in reserve management and cost reduction.

% In conclusion, the evolving electricity markets and ancillary services frameworks must adapt to the challenges posed by high \gls{vRES} penetration. Dynamic reserve procurement, supported by advanced forecasting techniques and market design improvements, offers a path toward more efficient and reliable power systems.


% The dynamic procurement of secondary reserves represents a significant step forward in addressing the inefficiencies inherent in traditional static allocation methods. Unlike static reserve procurement, which relies on fixed ratios or historical averages, dynamic approaches incorporate real-time forecasts and system conditions to adjust reserve requirements. This adaptability is particularly critical for modern electricity systems with high penetration of \gls{vRES}, where forecasting uncertainty and rapid changes in generation output challenge grid stability.

% Dynamic reserve procurement involves estimating upward and downward reserve needs based on the expected deviations between day-ahead scheduled generation and real-time demand. By leveraging advanced forecasting tools, such as machine learning models, it becomes possible to predict these deviations with greater accuracy, optimizing the allocation of secondary reserves. Historical data on vRES production, system demand, and grid imbalances serve as inputs to these models, allowing the identification of patterns and trends that inform reserve procurement decisions.

% Machine learning techniques, including \gls{LSTM} networks and other time-series forecasting models, have demonstrated significant potential for improving reserve predictions \cite{Costa2022}\cite{Benti2023}. These models can capture the nonlinear and temporal dependencies present in renewable energy data, outperforming traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA. By incorporating real-time weather forecasts, generation data, and demand profiles, dynamic approaches ensure that reserve procurement aligns more closely with actual system needs, reducing both over-procurement and under-procurement of reserves.

% The dynamic approach also allows for asymmetrical procurement of upward and downward reserves, which is particularly relevant in systems with variable renewable generation. For instance, during periods of high solar generation, upward reserves may be less critical, whereas downward reserves become essential to accommodate excess production. Conversely, during low renewable output, upward reserves are prioritized to address potential generation shortfalls.

% In summary, dynamic procurement of secondary reserves offers a more efficient and adaptive solution to balancing challenges in modern electricity systems. By leveraging machine learning techniques and real-time forecasts, this approach enhances reserve allocation, reduces operational costs, improving penetration of \gls{vRES}.
