To evaluate the aplicability of machine learning techniques for secondary reserve allocation the study was conducted using the Spanish electricity market historical data.

\subsection{Data Sources and Preprocessing}

The case study utilizes publicly available operational and historical data from the Spanish \gls{TSO}, \gls{REE}. Available at \href{https://www.esios.ree.es/es}{\gls{ESIOS}}. The dataset includes the following key variables:

\input{tables/indicators_metadata.tex}


The data spans multiple years to account for seasonal variability and long-term trends in vRES generation and demand. Data preprocessing only handled missing values using interpolation methods, with \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html}{IterativeImputer} \cite{vanBuuren2011}\cite{Buck1960}.:

    \label{fig:misisng_data}
  \end{figure}


To choose the temporal space of the models temporal auto-correlations were checked:

\input{tables/autocorrelation.tex}


We wanted to forecast \gls{DA} values, so we will be forecasting 24 hours ahead. As for the input for that forecast the temporal correlactions present 168 hours as the next correlation after the one day period, which represents a week.
We add also variable to account for each time range: day, day of year, month, day of week.\par
And so our models will receive data in (Batch Size, 168, 18) shape for input, and (Batch Size, 24, 1) shape for output.



\subsubsection{Training Data}
For training the full dataset from 2014 to 2023, inclusive was used. follows a description of said data:

\input{tables/tabela_dados_treino_medias.tex}

With each variable correlation to used secondary reserve energy:

\subsubsection{Validation Data}
As for validation it was chosen the year 2024.\par
Using the non comparitive metrics we have the following results:

And the correlation between allocated energy in the current method to the used energy can be seen in the following image:

\subsection{Results}

The best results for each architeture can be seen below, were Vanilla means it's only one layer deep, and Stacked means two layers deep:

\input{tables/tabela_res_metrics.tex}

Within the validation time, best model results can be summarized by:

\input{tables/tabela_res_model.tex}

With an overall description as follows:
% meter tableas dos resutlados com benchmark
\input{tables/tabela_modelos_res.tex}


The proposed model presente an overall improvement of \textasciitilde22\% in upward allocation amd \textasciitilde11\% in downward allocation, comparing to current allocation methods.\par

Where the hourly means differences between benchmark and validation results are:

% meter tableas dos resutlados dos deltas com benchmark
\input{tables/perc_delta_res.tex}

Average hourly improvements are of \textasciitilde16\% and \textasciitilde9\% respectively, which also is an improvement on state of the art \cite{Algarvio2024} with 13\% and 8\%.
The current study can free in average \textasciitilde12\% of hourly resources, lowering the average need to activate the third reserve in \textasciitilde21\% and \textasciitilde11\%.\par

We can also check that the correlation between used and alocated is bigger than in the current method, achieving 36\% in both upward energy and downward energy. \par

% The proposed dynamic reserve procurement methodology is implemented in three main steps:

% \subsubsection*{Forecasting Reserve Needs}
% Machine learning models are trained to predict the upward and downward reserve requirements based on day-ahead forecasts of vRES generation and system demand. Models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forests, and XGBoost are used to capture temporal and nonlinear dependencies in the data. The inputs to the models include historical forecasts, real-time deviations, and weather data.

% \subsubsection*{Dynamic Allocation of Reserves}
% Using the machine learning forecasts, the required reserve capacities are dynamically adjusted for upward and downward reserves. The allocation considers real-time deviations observed in previous periods and adjusts procurement to better match actual system needs.

% \subsubsection*{Performance Evaluation}
% The performance of the dynamic reserve procurement is evaluated using key metrics, including:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Forecast Error (RMSE and MAE)}: Measures the accuracy of reserve predictions.
%     \item \textbf{Reserve Utilization Rate}: Assesses the alignment between procured and activated reserves.
%     \item \textbf{Cost Efficiency}: Compares the costs of dynamic procurement with traditional static methods.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Results and Analysis}
% The results of the case study demonstrate significant improvements in reserve allocation efficiency compared to the traditional static methods currently used by the Spanish TSO.

% \subsubsection*{Forecast Accuracy}
% The machine learning models, particularly the LSTM network, outperformed traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA in predicting reserve requirements. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reduced by 15-20\% for both upward and downward reserve predictions.

% Incorporating weather variables into the models significantly improved the accuracy of vRES generation forecasts, which directly influenced reserve predictions.

% \subsubsection*{Reserve Utilization}
% The dynamic approach led to a higher utilization rate of procured reserves. The proportion of unused reserves was reduced by approximately 10\%, indicating a better alignment between forecasted and actual reserve needs.

% Asymmetrical reserve procurement allowed for flexibility in addressing specific system needs, such as prioritizing downward reserves during periods of high solar generation.

% \subsubsection*{Cost Efficiency}
% The dynamic procurement methodology reduced total reserve procurement costs by 8-12\% compared to static allocation methods. This cost savings was primarily driven by the reduction in over-procurement of reserves.

% The analysis showed that the optimized reserve allocation minimized the activation of expensive balancing reserves in the real-time market, further improving cost efficiency.

% \subsubsection*{Impact of vRES Penetration}
% The benefits of dynamic procurement were more pronounced during periods of high vRES penetration, where forecast uncertainty and variability were greatest. This highlights the importance of adapting reserve allocation methodologies to accommodate the increasing share of renewable generation.
