\chapter{Abstract}
The penetration in the grid and growing investment in variable renewable energy sources are changing the way electricity markets behave. Players rely on forecasts to participate in markets, closing between 1 and 37 hours ahead of real-time energy transactions. \\
Usually, transmission system operators (TSOs) use a symmetrical procurement for up and down secondary power allocation based on the expected demand for next day hourly consumptions. This work uses machine learning techniques that dynamically compute up and down secondary power reserves, using the day-ahead programmed and expected dispatches of variable Renewables, demand, and other  features.\\
The model inputs operational open data from the Spanish TSO from 2014 to 2023 for training. Benchmark and test data date from 2019 to 2022. The proposed methodology improves the usage of down secondary reserved power by around 36\% and up secondary reserved power by nearly 43\%.\\
