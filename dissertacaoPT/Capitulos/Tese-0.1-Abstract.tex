\chapter{Abstract}
The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, in the energy produtction markets, together with the paradigm shift in size and centralization of producers, brings instabilities and variability not in the scoope of current market models. \\

In turn, due to their less constante nature, these renewble producers have greater difficulties in making a profit in current models. \\

Forecast technologies are increasingly migrating to \emph{machine learning} models, with more accurate results. \\

This work proposes the application of neural network technologies to forecast forecast secondary reserve allocation bands, using data from the Iberian market. \\
