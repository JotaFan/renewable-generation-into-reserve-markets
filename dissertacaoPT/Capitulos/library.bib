   abstract = {Most energy markets (EMs) across Europe are based on a design framework involving day-ahead, intraday, and bilateral markets, operating together with balancing markets. This framework was set out, however, when the vast majority of generation units were controllable and fuel-based. The increasing levels of renewable generation create unique challenges in the operation of EMs. In this context, flexibility markets are starting to be recognized as a promising and powerful tool to adequately valorize demand-side flexibility. This chapter describes the models underlying both centralized and bilateral markets, analyzes the operation of several European markets, introduces some energy management tools, analyzes the pressing issue of flexibility in system operation, and describes various pioneering flexibility platforms.},

   abstract = {There is a need for fundamental changes in the ways society views electric energy. Electric energy must be treated as a commodity which can be bought, sold, and traded, taking into account its time-and space-varying values and costs. This book presents a complete framework for the establishment of such an energy marketplace. The framework is based on the use of spot prices. In general terms: o An hourly spot price (in dollars per kilowatt hour) reflects the operating and capital costs of generating, transmitting and distributing electric energy. It varies each hour and from place to place. o The spot price based energy marketplace involves a variety of utility-customer transactions (ranging from hourly varying prices to long-term, multiple-year contracts), all of which are based in a consistent manner on hourly spot prices. These transactions may include customers selling to, as well as buying from, the utility. The basic theory and practical implementation issues associated with a spot price based energy marketplace have been developed and discussed through a number of different reports, theses, and papers. Each addresses only a part of the total picture, and often with a somewhat different notation and terminology (which has evolved in parallel with our growing experience). This book was xvii xviii Preface written to serve as a single, integrated sourcebook on the theory and imple­ mentation of a spot price based energy marketplace. 1 Overview -- 1.1 Goal of Book -- 1.2 Three Steps to an Energy Marketplace -- 1.3 How Will Customers Respond? -- 1.4 Energy Marketplace Operation: A Developed Country -- 1.5 Energy Marketplace Operation: A Developing Country -- 1.6 Discussion of Chapter 1 -- I: The Energy Marketplace -- Preface to Part I: The Energy Marketplace -- 2 Behavior of Hourly Spot Prices -- 3 Energy Marketplace Transactions -- 4 Implementation -- 5 A Possible Future: Deregulation -- II: Theory of Hourly Spot Prices -- 6 Generation Only -- 7 Generation and Network -- 8 Revenue Reconciliation -- 9 Spot Price Based Rates -- 10 Optimal Investment Conditions -- References -- Annotated Bibliography -- Appendices -- A Power System Analysis and Control -- A.1 Network Flows -- A.2 Local Controllers -- A.3 Mathematical Models for System Dynamics -- A.4 Power System Dynamics -- Further Reading -- Notes -- B Power System Operation -- B.1 Short-Term Load Forecasting -- B.2 System Economics -- B.3 System Security -- B.4 Automatic Generation Control (AGC) -- B.5 Interconnected Systems -- Further Reading -- Notes -- C Power System Planning -- C.1 Multiple Attribute Decision Making Under Uncertainty -- C.2 Long Range Load Forecasting Models -- C.3 Production Cost Models -- C.4 Financial Models -- C.5 Generation Expansion Programs -- C.6 Network Expansion Programs -- C.7 Feedback Couplings -- Further Reading -- Notes -- D DC Load Flow -- D.1 General Relationships -- D.2 A Potpourri of Results -- D.3 Three-Bus Example -- Notes -- E Customer Response Model Structures -- E.1 Single Period -- E.2 Multiple Period -- Notes -- F FAPER -- F.1 Basic Concepts -- F.2 FAPER Designs -- F.3 Variations on the Basic Concept -- F.4 Analysis of Multiple FAPER Response -- F.5 Incentives to Install FAPERS -- F.6 Discussion -- G Expected Behavior of Spot Prices -- G.1 Introduction -- G.2 24-Hour Trajectories -- G.3 Price Duration Curves -- G.4 Impact of Customer Response on Variable Energy Costs -- H Interchange of Derivative and Expectation Operators.},
