An alternative is to estimate the missing values by regression techniques and to calculate a revised variance-covariance matrix. This method is suitable for use with an electronic computer. It is shown that with this method the resultant covariances are unbiased, but that the variances require correction for bias. A numerical example is given.]},

   abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

   abstract = {The paper considers different market settings for the participation to the balancing services market of small scale variable renewable energy sources connected to the distribution grid. By mixing an economical and a technical approach, it evaluates the efficiency of participation to the market under two distinct approaches to resources' aggregation: a commercial scheme and a technical one. In the former, the supply of the small scale variable distributed renewable energy sources is grouped on a purely commercial basis; in the latter, the distribution system operator is responsible of the imbalances that may possibly arise in the distribution grid and aggregates the sources from a technical perspective. By considering a reference distribution network and designing scenarios for the forecast uncertainty about supply and demand of power profiles, the impact of different market frameworks is assessed. The upward and downward balancing services provided by variable distributed energy resources and controllable units connected to the high voltage grid are both considered. Moreover, the power supply curtailments, that endogenously arise due to the violation of technical constraints of the distribution grid and the random nature of energy supply by renewables, are addressed, for each specific market model. As a general outcome of this research, it is shown that providing balancing energy based on a commercial approach is preferable as long as renewables' curtailment penalty is low and local generators have correlated forecast errors (as in the case of photovoltaic units) with a large reserve capacity. High penalties for curtailment and lower correlation among generation schedule deviations, along with a lower reserve by distributed units, make the technical approach more convenient.},

   abstract = {In order to increase the amount of renewable energy generation in the electrical grids and
at the same time keep the existing power quality and safety of supply, it is mandatory that
these energy sources not only deliver energy, but also perform ancillary services. Consequently
the wind, solar, water and biomass units should be able to supply frequency containment,
restoration and replacement reserve services.
The installed capacity of wind generators has risen in recent years, which means that
increasingly larger shares of electricity will be supplied by these sources. During off-peak hours
this will lead to situations where wind generators become the main electricity supplier.
Therefore, wind farms should be encouraged to participate in balance markets so that the
system’s stability does not become threatened.
In this dissertation, it is analysed the possibility and the impact of Wind Farms in
participating in the electrical energy market and in the replacement reserve market.
This work starts with an investigation, on the existing literature, with regard to the physical
feasibility of wind farms to provide active power control. Afterwards it is delineated different
forecasting tools: of wind power production, of regulation’s direction and needed power and
of balance market prices. This literature review is compulsory for a better understanding of the
problem of bidding in balance markets.
Subsequently it is formulated the decision problem to define the offers of a wind farm.
Then a decision support model, based on probabilistic forecasts of: wind generation, balance
market prices and regulation’s direction, for the offering of control reserve provision is
presented. Different decision strategies were implemented, and from the comparison of them
conclusions were made.},

   abstract = {Every day the Operator Transport Network (ORT) is facing new challenges that will have
to overcome in favor of providing users of the national electricity system with a service
quality, reliability and safety. At times, the electric sector was traditionally seen as a
natural monopoly, where a company, EDP, was responsible for all sector activities.
However, given the restructuring that took place throughout the sector, which led to the
introduction by weight of renewable energy sources and the liberalization of various
activities led to the value chain separation and accept the participation of various actors
in various activities, namely, the production and marketing, with the aim of creating a
more competitive and more advantageous environment for the consumer. This process
gave rise to challenges of greater complexity, among which there is the greatest volatility
in electricity production and a possibility of experiencing imbalances, for which system
services provision for the maintenance of the electrical system fullness is needed.
The continued development of the sector liberalization process culminated in the creation
of transnational electricity markets, grouping electricity markets in different countries in
a single market. The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), is an example of an
international market which incorporates in itself the electricity markets in Portugal and
Spain. The MIBEL in addition to other responsibilities coordinates the management of
the Daily Market and Intraday Market, where you set the electricity price and the price
thereof to be traded the next day and every hour of the day.
With regard to the System Services Market, whose responsibility is the system manager,
and are characterized by estimating the differences that may occur in an electrical system,
develop resolution plans for them and finally arrange and implement the solution. The
resolution involves the procurement of supplies in quantities able to cope with anomalies
recorded in the system services market.
This research focuses on the System Services, in particular on frequency regulation,
including secondary and tertiary regulation reserve for the electrical systems of Portugal
and Spain for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Under the regulation reserve, an analysis of the creation of an internal market concerning
the commercialization of regulation reserve was carried out in parallel, was conceived to
viione analysis support tool in Microsoft Office Excel that allows you to view as graphics
stored data relating to offers of market agents, contracted reserve, the marginal cost of
these offers and finally, the cost of closing the market. The same tool also enables the
user to make a simulation to the desired day of what may occur in regulatory reserve
market in accordance with the provisions ERSE.
With respect to the reserve secondary regulation, we carried out a study of the possible
optimization of the values of the supply requirements of such reserves, with the intention
to decrease the closing market price at each time.
The results showed that there is still great potential for development of system services,
more specifically in the management of the secondary reserve and regulating the market,
which will culminate in the creation of a single market at European level, the benefit of
which will be based on reduced costs for the system and therefore to the final consumers.
The creation of a single regulatory reserve market is one of the proposals, and the positive
values achieved enable its creation, however, due to the complexity of the secondary
reserve market presents the creation of a single market is still a process which will have
difficulties to be implemented. However, the proposal for obtaining the value of
secondary reserve enables the GGS needs an optimization of the costs associated with the
system.},

   abstract = {There is a need for fundamental changes in the ways society views electric energy. Electric energy must be treated as a commodity which can be bought, sold, and traded, taking into account its time-and space-varying values and costs. This book presents a complete framework for the establishment of such an energy marketplace. The framework is based on the use of spot prices. In general terms: o An hourly spot price (in dollars per kilowatt hour) reflects the operating and capital costs of generating, transmitting and distributing electric energy. It varies each hour and from place to place. o The spot price based energy marketplace involves a variety of utility-customer transactions (ranging from hourly varying prices to long-term, multiple-year contracts), all of which are based in a consistent manner on hourly spot prices. These transactions may include customers selling to, as well as buying from, the utility. The basic theory and practical implementation issues associated with a spot price based energy marketplace have been developed and discussed through a number of different reports, theses, and papers. Each addresses only a part of the total picture, and often with a somewhat different notation and terminology (which has evolved in parallel with our growing experience).
